# Codes for papers

### (01) SPDtoolbox

-   `MATLAB` library to study functional connectivity represented as symmetric postiive-definite (SPD) matrices.
-   Algorithms for learning on the SPD manifold are implemented with AIRM and LERM geometries.
-   See **`README.md`** in the folder for
    -   adding the path,
    -   the list of available functions, and
    -   some examples with our library.
-   This library is associated with the following paper:\
    [You and Park (2021). Re-visiting Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices for the analysis of functional connectivity. *NeuroImage*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117464).

### (02) CORRbox

-   `MATLAB` library for learning with functional connectivity represented as correlation matrices, which are symmetric positive-definite matrices with unit diagonals. We consider a Riemannian framework to view the space of correlation matrices as a quotient of SPD manifold equipped with AIRM.
-   See **`README.md`** in the folder for
    -   adding the path,
    -   the list of available functions, and
    -   some examples with our library.

### (03) TopLSM

-   A set of `R` scripts to replicate examples from a manuscript titled "*Multiple Latent Spaces Comparison Using Topological Analysis*".

# Resources for Papers

This repo contains a set of scripts/packages/supplementary materials that are associated with the 
manuscripts and papers. Please see the list below for introduction to 
available folders and relevant files within each folder for detailed description.

### (05) OTvMF

-   A set of `R` notebooks for the following paper:\
    ["Learning over von Mises--Fisher distributions via a Wasserstein-like-geometry"](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.14164
).
-   It contains step-by-step descriptions to replicate examples in the paper along with some precomputed data files.


### (04) splaplace

-   This folder contains an online supplementary pdf file for the paper titled ["On the Spherical Laplace Distribution"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224108) at the *26th International Conference on Information Fusion*.


### (03) TopLSM

-   A set of `R` scripts to replicate examples from a manuscript titled "*Multiple Latent Spaces Comparison Using Topological Analysis*".

### (02) CORRbox

-   `MATLAB` library for learning with functional connectivity represented as correlation matrices, which are symmetric positive-definite matrices with unit diagonals. We consider a Riemannian framework to view the space of correlation matrices as a quotient of SPD manifold equipped with AIRM.
-   See **`README.md`** in the folder for
    -   adding the path,
    -   the list of available functions, and
    -   some examples with our library.
-   This library is associated with the following paper:\
    [You and Park (2022).  Geometric learning of functional brain network on the correlation manifold. *Scientific Reports*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21376-0).

### (01) SPDtoolbox

-   `MATLAB` library to study functional connectivity represented as symmetric postiive-definite (SPD) matrices.
-   Algorithms for learning on the SPD manifold are implemented with AIRM and LERM geometries.
-   See **`README.md`** in the folder for
    -   adding the path,
    -   the list of available functions, and
    -   some examples with our library.
-   This library is associated with the following paper:\
    [You and Park (2021). Re-visiting Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices for the analysis of functional connectivity. *NeuroImage*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117464).

# Codes and Examples from Papers

### (1) SPDtoolbox
  * `MATLAB` library to study functional connectivity represented as symmetric postiive-definite (SPD) matrices. 
  * Algorithms for learning on the SPD manifold are implemented with AIRM and LERM geometries.
  * See **`README.md`** in the folder for 
      - adding the path,
      - the list of available functions, and 
      - some examples with our library.
  * This library is associated with the following paper:  
  [You and Park (2021). Re-visiting Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices for the analysis of functional connectivity. *NeuroImage*][1].
  
  
### (2) CORRbox
  * `MATLAB` library for learning with functional connectivity represented as correlation matrices, which are symmetric positive-definite matrices with unit diagonals. We consider a Riemannian framework to view the space of correlation matrices as a quotient of SPD manifold equipped with AIRM.
  * See **`README.md`**  in the folder for 
      - adding the path,
      - the list of available functions, and 
      - some examples with our library.

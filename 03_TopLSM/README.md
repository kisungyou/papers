There are two files 'example_ER.R' and 'example_SBM.R' for replicating 
simulated examples. Both scripts contain installation of dependencies, 
path setting, data generation, inference, and visualization. The 'src.R' 
file contains auxiliary functions that are called from two example scripts. 
We strongly recommend to run these scripts in Rstudio.
